/* .spinnerContainer class:

This class is used for styling a container that will hold the spinner.
It sets the container's height to 100% of its parent, making it take up the full height.
The display: flex property is used to create a flex container, and align-items: center and justify-content: center are used to vertically and horizontally center the content (in this case, the spinner).
.spinner class:

This class is used for styling the actual spinner.
width and height are set to create a square shape with a size of 6rem (6 rem units).
border-radius: 50% is used to make the spinner a perfect circle by giving it a border radius of 50%.
background property is set to a conic gradient, creating a gradient that appears as a rotating circle. The gradient starts with transparent color (#0000) and ends with a light color (var(--color-light--2)).
-webkit-mask property is used to define an alpha mask for the element. In this case, it's a radial gradient that creates a circular mask. The mask is used to control the visibility of the element based on the gradient.
animation property is used to apply the rotate animation to the spinner. The animation lasts for 1.5 seconds, is set to rotate infinitely (infinite), and follows a linear timing function.
@keyframes rotate:

This is a keyframes rule defining the rotate animation.
It rotates the element by 1turn (which is equivalent to 360 degrees), making a full rotation.
Overall, this CSS is creating a visually appealing spinning/loading animation. The -webkit-mask property is used for browser compatibility, and it defines how the spinner should be masked to create the desired visual effect. */
